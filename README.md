# Character Jump

This project has since been depreciated in favour for Analogies.io 

Character Jump was to be a mental health platform that utilised this idea of 'characters' as a means to help people better understand themselves. 

Unfortunately, I've come to discover that while great in theory, doesn't quite work in practice - due to a number of limitations.
