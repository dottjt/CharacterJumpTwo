# Character Jump

This project has since been depreciated in favour for [Analogies.io](https://github.com/dottjt/analogies)
 
Character Jump was to be a mental health platform that utilised this idea of 'characters' as a means to help people better understand themselves. 

Unfortunately, I don't think it quite worked in practice - due to a number of limitations.
